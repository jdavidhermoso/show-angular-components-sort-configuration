# Ordered Components Angular

This repo shows how I managed to show some Angular components sort by a back-end configuration.
It's the code of the solution described in this dev.to [article](https://dev.to/jdavidhermoso/how-to-show-angular-components-in-specific-order-according-to-a-backend-configuration-498m):

That was my solution. If you think there's a better solution and you want to discuss it, you can ping me at:

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.7.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `yarn test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
